	"description": "A looping nightmare in the heart of Kamuning.\nYou're a CIITzen heading home after a long day, until you remember something left behind at school. One quick stop, you think. But when you return to Kamuning Road, nothing feels right.\nThe streets are too quiet. The lights too dim. And every attempt to leave pulls you deeper into a loop you can't escape. The halls shift. Time bends. Are you still in Kamuningâ€¦ or somewhere else entirely?\nEscape Kamuning is a psychological horror puzzle game that blurs the lines between the familiar and the uncanny. Explore your surroundings, solve unsettling puzzles, and uncover the truth behind the endless night.\nWill you find your way out, or will you remain trapped forever?",
