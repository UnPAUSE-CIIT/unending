	"description": "Differential diagnosis in video game form — stories inspired by the cases of House MD as a half 2D visual novel and half 3D first person puzzle adventure inspired by the mysteries of Ace Attorney and Hotel Dusk: Room 215.\nA patient comes in and describes their symptoms, and you are given a list of everything it could be – all with buts.\nIt could be illness #1, but it wouldn’t explain one other symptom. It could be illness #2, but if you’re wrong, the patient could die immediately from the treatment for the diagnosis you decided to give. For each potential diagnosis, there are lists of tests given that can either further confirm a diagnosis or remove it as a possibility.\nHowever, sometimes medical diagnostic exams just aren’t enough – some symptoms could be explained by exposure to a certain chemical or mold for a long amount of time – check where they live or where they work for information the patient or hospital wouldn’t be able to give you.\nThree levels. Three patients. Three stories.\nThree medical mysteries — until you came along.\nInterrogate, investigate, deduce, then make a diagnosis and hope it’s the right one.",
