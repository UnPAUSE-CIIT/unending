got proper line wrapping working (ty gpt <3)

TODO:
- move to using Rects for layout (rect.odin added but not used for now)
- create python tool for scraping stuff for itch downloader
	- this should result into a "get-the-files.exe"

revamped the basic UI, new bottom bar!

we can't really rotate text without using a render texture, so i just made the rotated text in Figma, then just drew the texture then rotated it afterwards LMAO

in the future tho, what we can do for the bottom bar is:
layout the text, the bg, then draw them to a render texture with BeginTextureMode(canvas)
the `canvas` is just a Texture2D that you render afterwards with DrawTexturePro or something
